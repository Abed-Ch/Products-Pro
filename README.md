##About

This Aplication is a simple crud app. Its a products application where the user can create, read and delete a product.

###Main Page

On the main page we get the products list, the items are displayed in order of insertion. We have a total of 3 product types (A Book, A DVD, Furniture).
Each Product has its own unique Attribute (Book -> Pages, Furniture -> Dimensions, DVD -> Runtime). Lastly each product card has a delete button that will delete the product (For maintaining a presentable index page, the products wont be deleted).
